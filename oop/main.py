# OOP is abject oriented programming, where in place of writing functions and variables we use classes and objects.
# it help to have our code DRY: DONT REPEAT YOURSELF.

# what is class,object,properties and methods, inheritance, 
# Class is like a blueprint, and object is like
class MyClass:
    x = 5
p = MyClass()
print(p.x)

# database = mysql
