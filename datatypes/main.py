# what is datatype?
# it refers to the classification or categorization of data items.  
# two types of datatype: 
# 1.primitive: int,floot,str,bool,complex,none
# 2.non-primitive: list,tuple,set,dict
# PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES: They are the ones that have only one value.
# NON-PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES: They are the ones that have multiple values.


# a = 4.123456
# print(f"{a:.2f}")  
''' when you want to have the value print with only 2 digit after the point thus we get 4.12 as the output and it also round up
say  you have a = 4.567812 than you will get 4.57'''

# complex data type: it refers to imaginary numbers where we use j/J.
# a= 5j
# print(type(a))

b= 7+6J
# here 7 is the real number and 6 is the imaginary number
print(b.real)
print(b.imag)
